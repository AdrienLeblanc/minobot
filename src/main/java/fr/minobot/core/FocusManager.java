/**
 * Brings a game window to the foreground — the counterpart of {@code focus_manager.py}.
 *
 * <p>Windows refuses {@code SetForegroundWindow} to a process that does not already own the
 * foreground. The workaround, is to press ALT first: it makes the
 * OS treat the call as user-driven. It is timing- and policy-dependent, which is why it is the first
 * thing to check against the real game.
 *
 * <p>There are two kinds of focus here, and the difference matters. A <em>deliberate</em>
 * {@link #focus(long)} comes from a hotkey: it waits its turn and it reports whether it worked, so a
 * caller that is about to type knows whether the keystrokes will land in the window it asked for. An
 * {@link #focusIfIdle(long)} comes from a toast: it is a convenience, and it stands aside rather than
 * take the screen from under a sequence that is halfway through typing a command.
 *
 * <p>Every step sleeps, so this is meant to be called from a virtual thread (a hotkey callback),
 * never from the polling loop.
