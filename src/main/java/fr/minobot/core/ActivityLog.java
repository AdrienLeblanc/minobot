/**
 * What Minobot has just been doing, kept so the panel can show it.
 *
 * <p>Every feature here acts <strong>while the player is looking at something else</strong> — that is the
 * whole point of them. A turn ends in a window the player is not on, a trade is accepted in a blink, a
 * relay walks eight characters. Left with nothing but the result, the player is asked to trust that the
 * right thing happened; a short list of what happened is the difference between a tool and a black box.
 * The log file says all of this already, but a log file is not something a player reads mid-fight.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately <strong>small and forgetful</strong>: {@link #CAPACITY} entries, oldest dropped,
 * nothing on disk. It answers "what did that just do?" and nothing else — the day it is asked to answer
 * "what happened this session?", it is the log file that should be opened, not this made bigger.
 *
 * <p>Written from every hotkey's and every notification's virtual thread, and read from the panel's:
 * {@link #record} and {@link #recent()} are therefore synchronized on the deque itself. The cost is a
 * lock held for an add and a copy, on a path that already went through the window manager.
