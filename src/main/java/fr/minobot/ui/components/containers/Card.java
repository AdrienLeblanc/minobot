/**
 * A card: a rounded sheet, drawn rather than bordered, so its corners are not square. The base surface
 * everything on a themed panel rests on, and the column its contents stack in.
 *
 * <p>Three factories cover the shapes the panel needs: {@link #sheet} for the panel's own outermost
 * surface, drawn at the widest radius of the nesting order; {@link #column} for a card resting on it; and
 * {@link #plainColumn} for a stack that carries no surface of its own — a group of rows that sits
 * <em>on</em> a card rather than being one.
 *
 * <p>A column can be <strong>{@link #pinnedTo pinned to a width}</strong>, which is how the panel's
 * halves keep their places: the team is as wide as a name and a class need and no wider, so a long
 * character name never moves the console beside it. The pin holds the <em>width</em> only, and reads the
 * height from the contents at every layout — the character list is resized under its card as the game
 * leaves it less room, and a card that had been pinned to a height would ignore that.
