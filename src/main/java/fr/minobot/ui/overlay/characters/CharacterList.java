/**
 * The characters, on tiles of their own, dragged into the order the cycler follows. It owns the list
 * model and decides what a click on a row means; the scrollable, reorderable shell it lives in — and
 * the raw mouse handling that shell needs — is a reusable {@link SmartTable}.
 *
 * <p>Every click is routed by hand — a drag reorders, a click on the class cell or a double-click anywhere
 * on the row opens the picker, a click on a disconnected row's forget cross drops it — because the window
 * this list lives on never takes the focus, and Swing's own drag-and-drop and selection machinery expects
 * a window that does. The {@link SmartTable} does the routing; this class supplies the meaning.
