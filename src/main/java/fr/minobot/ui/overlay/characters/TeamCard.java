/**
 * The team: who the player runs, in the order the cycler walks them, under a heading that counts how many
 * are actually on screen.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing here asks to be refreshed.</strong> The card once carried a {@code Reload} button;
 * the panel now re-reads the desktop when it opens and while it is up (see {@code OverlayController}), so
 * the button could only ever be pressed to be told what the card already said.
 *
 * <p>It is the <strong>left half of the panel</strong> and the one part of it the player edits — so it is
 * given a fixed width and the console beside it takes the rest. A team card that grew with the longest
 * character name would move the console every time somebody logged in.
 *
 * <p>The card owns the heading and the footer; the rows and what a click on one means are
 * {@link CharacterList}'s. The orchestrator shrinks the list through this card, because the list is the
 * one part of the whole panel that can be short and still be usable.
