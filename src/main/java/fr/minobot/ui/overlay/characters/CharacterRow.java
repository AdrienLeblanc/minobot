/**
 * A character on a tile of their own, so a row can be picked up by eye before it is by hand: the grip it
 * is dragged by, its rank in the cycle, its class icon, its name, the class it is pinned to, and whether
 * its window is open right now.
 *
 * <p><strong>A character on screen wears the ember down its left edge; one who is not, does not.</strong>
 * That stripe is the row's whole state, said before anything is read — the fill, the name, the icon and
 * the index all step back a shade with it, so eight rows sort themselves into "playing" and "not" at a
 * glance and the green dot only confirms it.
 *
 * <p>The row is divided into six columns by {@link RowColumns}, the one layout {@link CharacterList} also
 * reads so its click routing lands on the very cells drawn here. This class draws a cell per column; how
 * wide each column is lives in {@code RowColumns}, so the two never disagree on where a cell begins.
