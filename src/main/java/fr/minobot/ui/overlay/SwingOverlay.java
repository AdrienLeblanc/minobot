/**
 * The panel, in Swing — the orchestrator that owns the window and lays the sections out on it. The
 * drawing of each part lives in its own class ({@link HeaderBar}, {@link TeamCard}, {@link ConsoleCard},
 * {@link KeybindsDrawer}, {@link ClassPicker}, {@link SizeSlider}); this wires them onto the
 * {@link Sheet} and keeps the panel's transient state — whether the keybinds drawer is open, and which
 * character the class picker is open for.
 *
 * <p><strong>The panel is two halves and one line.</strong> The header names the surface and shows the
 * key that summons it; the {@code TeamCard} on the left is what the player <em>edits</em>; the
 * {@code ConsoleCard} on the right is what Minobot has been <em>doing</em>. The team is given a fixed
 * width and the console takes the rest, so a long character name never moves the console.
 *
 * <p><strong>It must never take the foreground.</strong> There is one screen, and
 * {@code core.FocusManager} is what keeps the features from fighting over it: a panel that stole the
 * focus would land between two keystrokes of the invitation relay and send the rest of an
 * {@code /invite} to another character's window. Hence {@code setFocusableWindowState(false)} — a
 * window that receives the mouse and never the activation — and hence, too, the fact that
 * <strong>nothing here is typed</strong>: a keybind is read from the keyboard by
 * {@link OverlayActions#captureHotkey()}, not typed into a text field that would need the focus.
 *
 * <p>That one line is enough, and it was <em>measured</em> against the real game rather than assumed —
 * both when the panel is shown and when it is clicked, the character the player is on keeps the
 * screen. <strong>Do not add {@code WS_EX_NOACTIVATE} to the window to make sure</strong>: Swing
 * already does this one, and the extended style would be a native call bought for nothing.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every size is a natural size, and none of them is a pixel.</strong> The panel covers the
 * game, and the game is played on screens of every size; each size reaches the screen multiplied by the
 * player's scale through a {@link Scale} — {@link Scale#px} for a length, {@link Scale#font} for a
 * typeface. A size that skips them is a size that will be wrong on somebody's monitor.
 *
 * <p>Two threads meet here, and neither may do the other's work. Swing lives on the event dispatch
 * thread, while {@code toggle()} arrives on the virtual thread of a hotkey — so every method below
 * hands its work to the EDT. And {@code captureHotkey()} <em>blocks</em>, waiting for a human, so it is
 * the one thing that must leave the EDT — see {@link KeybindsDrawer}.
