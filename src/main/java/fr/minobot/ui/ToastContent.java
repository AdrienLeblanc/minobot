/**
 * What the whisper stack shows: the private messages a background character has received and not yet

 * the panel.
 *
 * <p>Cards, not windows or toasts — each says which of the player's characters was whispered, by whom,
 * and the line they sent. The {@code id} is how the view names a card back when it is clicked or its
 * cross is pressed: the model made it, so the model can find it again.
 *
 * <p>The list is in the order the whispers arrived, oldest first. The view stacks them from a fixed
 * base with the last at the bottom, so the newest sits closest to the eye.
 *
 * <p>The scale is the player's — the same {@code overlay_scale} the panel is drawn at, because the
 * stack covers a band of the same game on the same monitor. It is a multiplier of the natural size of
 * every piece of a card, and the view is the only one that knows what those natural sizes are.
