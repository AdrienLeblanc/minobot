/**
 * The control panel: the characters Minobot has found, the order they are cycled in, and the key each
 * feature answers to — all of it editable, on top of the game.
 *
 * <p><strong>A reorder, a rebind, a class and a sex are kept; the rest is not.</strong> The character
 * order, the keybinds and each character's class and sex go through {@link Settings} and are persisted to
 * {@code overlay.json} (see {@link fr.minobot.app.OverlayState}), so they survive a restart. The scale
 * and the two switches also go
 * through {@link Settings}, but nothing persists them: they live for the session only, the switches
 * deliberately — an {@code Auto-pass} found already on after a restart would end turns nobody asked it
 * to. The controller does not know which of the two happens; it just calls {@code settings.update}.
 *
 * <p>The panel <em>belongs to a character</em>. It covers their game — the client area exactly, never
 * the title bar Windows draws above it — and it <em>follows</em> it: move the window, resize it, and
 * the panel goes with it. Pressing the hotkey anywhere but on a game window does nothing at all. Not
 * "shown somewhere by default": outside the game there is no character for it to belong to, and a panel
 * that appears over a window the player was not looking at is a panel they did not ask for.
 *
 * <p><strong>It never has to be told to look again.</strong> The desktop is re-read when the panel opens
 * and every couple of seconds while it is up, and the panel is redrawn only when what came back differs
 * from what is on the screen. That is why there is no {@code Reload} button: the one thing it did, the
 * panel now does at the two moments the player would have thought to press it.
 *
 * <p>Once up it <em>stays</em> up, whatever takes the foreground next: a toast pulling the focus to
 * another character, the player clicking into another application. The panel is always-on-top, and
 * always-on-top owes nothing to the focus. The hotkey is the only switch — except that a character who
 * leaves takes their panel with them: minimized, or closed, and it goes.
 *
 * <p>It never takes the foreground itself — see {@code OverlayView}. It must not: {@link
 * fr.minobot.core.FocusManager} is what keeps the features from fighting over the one screen, and a
 * panel that stole the focus would land in the middle of the invitation relay's keystrokes.
