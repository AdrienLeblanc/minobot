/**
 * Puts the characters back in order in the taskbar — the counterpart of {@code window_reorder.py}.
 *
 * <p>The player wants their taskbar buttons in the player's character order, and Windows
 * offers no way to move a button: the only lever is the order in which the windows appear. So the
 * characters all leave the screen, and come back one by one in the order they should be in.
 *
 * <p>They are <em>gone</em> in the middle of this: a sequence that dies there leaves the player with no
 * characters and no way to get them back. Every failure path therefore ends in
 * {@link #bringEverybodyBack()}.
