/**
 * Takes the player to the character who needs them — the counterpart of {@code notification_listener.py}.
 *
 * <p>The game raises a Windows toast whenever a background character is attacked, messaged or invited.
 * This turns that toast into a move: the character who called out gets the screen, without the player
 * having to look for them.
 *
 * <p>It is a move that <em>yields</em>: it never takes the screen from under a player who is in the
 * middle of something, and never from under one of the scripted sequences.
 *
 * <p>And it <em>stands aside</em> for a toast another feature answers silently. The trade-accepter,
 * when one of the player's own characters asks another for an exchange, accepts it in place without
 * moving the screen — a move this listener would otherwise undo by jumping to the receiver. The
 * predicate is how it knows to leave those alone; every other toast, an outsider's trade included, it
 * still takes the player to.
