/**
 * Shows a standing banner over the game while the turn-passer is on — the visible half of a feature that
 * would otherwise leave no sign it is running but the turns ending by themselves.
 *
 * <p>It answers no toast, unlike its neighbours here: {@link TurnPasser} is what ends the turns, reading
 * the {@code auto_pass_turn} switch at each one. This class watches that same switch — through
 * {@link Settings#onChange} — and, while it is on, hangs a pill at the top of the foreground game saying
 * so.
 *
 * <p><strong>The banner cannot be dismissed, only obeyed.</strong> Its one button turns the feature
 * <em>off</em>; there is no cross that hides the sign and leaves the turns ending. A player who has
 * stepped away comes back to a game that has been playing itself, and the only thing telling them so is
 * this pill — a version of it they could have waved away hours ago would be worse than no banner at all.
 * The banner therefore goes when, and only when, the switch goes.
 *
 * <p>Like the panel and the whisper stack it <em>follows</em>: a single virtual thread keeps the banner
 * pinned to the foreground game window, or takes it away while the player is out of the game. The loop
 * runs only while the switch is on; virtual threads are daemons, so a banner still up at shutdown holds
 * nothing up.
 *
 * <p>Its UI surface is cut on the same interface/impl seam as the overlay and the whisper stack
 * ({@link BannerView} and {@link BannerActions}), so all the deciding stays testable with no screen.
