/**
 * Turns a private message into a quiet toast instead of a jump — the counterpart of the notification
 * auto-focus for one kind of toast only.
 *
 * <p>The game raises a Windows toast whenever a background character is whispered, and left alone the
 * {@link NotificationListener} would pull the whole screen to them — too much for one line of chat. So
 * this stands in front of that toast: it recognises a whisper by the shape of its message, and rather
 * than move the player it shows a small card at the left edge of the game — who was whispered, by whom,
 * and what they said. The card lives for {@link #TOAST_LIFETIME}, a close cross takes it down early, and
 * a click on it brings the receiver up so the player can answer. Several whispers stack.
 *
 * <p>It is the mirror of {@link ExchangeAccepter} and {@link TurnPasser}: a feature that registers with
 * {@link NotificationManager}, speaks of <strong>characters</strong> ({@link GameWindow#name()}), and
 * keeps the Windows detail — the French wording the message is matched by — in one named constant. Its
 * one novelty is a UI surface, cut on the overlay's interface/impl seam ({@link ToastView} and
 * {@link ToastActions}) so all the deciding stays testable with no screen.
 *
 * <p>Like the panel it <em>follows</em>: a single virtual thread re-reads the foreground game window and
 * keeps the stack pinned to it, or takes it away while the player is out of the game. The follow loop is
 * also where a toast dies of old age — one poll evicts what has expired, so there is no timer thread per
 * card. It runs only while there is something to show, and virtual threads are daemons, so a toast still
 * alive at shutdown holds nothing up.
