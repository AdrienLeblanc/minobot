# The toast-driven features

The features that live on the game's **Windows toasts**. The game raises one when a background
character is attacked, invited, messaged, offered a trade, or has a turn to play; these features turn
that toast into an action. Each **speaks of characters** (`GameWindow`) and keeps the Windows detail —
the French wording a message is matched by — in one named constant. Read `core/CLAUDE.md` (*The
foreground is a single resource*) before touching any of them: they all react to the same stream and
compete for the one screen.

## The `claims` seam

The **notification auto-focus** (`NotificationListener`) answers *every* game toast by pulling the
screen to the character it names. Some toasts, though, are answered **in place** by another feature — a
whisper becomes a card, an internal trade accepts itself — and the auto-focus must not also jump to
them. So each of those features exposes a **pure `claims(Notification)`**, and the auto-focus is built
with the **OR** of them (combined in `MinobotApp`): both sides decide the same, from the same toast,
with no handshake and no race. A new feature that answers a toast silently adds its `claims` to that OR
and nothing else.

`NotificationListener.onNotification` is **`public`** where the handlers here are package-private: the
invitation relay in `group/` is tested directly against it (a toast must not steal the foreground from
the relay's keystrokes), and that test lives in another package.

## Auto-pass turns — the overlay's switch, a toggle key, and a banner

Plays a table of alts on its own. In a fight the game raises a toast for whoever's turn it is —
`C'est à "Bravo" de jouer` — and when the switch is on, `TurnPasser` turns that toast into a keypress:
it brings the character up and presses the game's end-turn key (`F1`, a constant — the key is the
game's, not the player's). A background character's turn ends without the player lifting a finger.

It passes **every** character's turn, the foreground one included: the switch is the player saying they
have stepped away, not that they are playing one of the seats — so there is no "except the one I am on".
That is why it is **off by default**, and why the switch is drawn to be unmistakable.

Like the invitation relay it focuses a window and then types into it, so it holds the foreground for the
length of that (`focus.takeOver()`): the notification auto-focus answers the same toast, and without the
takeover its focus would land between the focus and the keypress and end a turn in the wrong window. A
`ReentrantLock` serializes one pass against the next for the same reason. It is a **combat** feature and
the group invitation is done **before** the fight — the two are not meant to share the screen, and do
not. The switch is read live at every toast; unlike the order and the
keybinds its **state** is **session-only** — not persisted, so a restart forgets it and finds it off,
which is the safe default for a feature that ends turns on its own.

**Two ways to flip it, and one to see it.** The overlay carries the switch, and — new — an
`AUTO_PASS_TURN` hotkey (default `shift+middle`) toggles it too. That hotkey is the odd one in the
`Feature` enum: its action *toggles the switch* rather than firing a one-shot, and a blank combination
only leaves it keyless (the switch still works) instead of disabling the feature. `MinobotApp` binds it
to `OverlayController.flipAutoPassTurn`, so a press and the panel's pill land on the same `settings.update`
and stay in step. The *key combination* is persisted like every other keybind; the on/off *state* is not.

`AutoPassBanner` is the **visible half**: while the switch is on it hangs an ember **pill** at the
**top-centre** of the foreground game — a live dot, `AUTO-PASS TURNS`, and *every character passes* — so a
feature that otherwise shows nothing but turns ending by themselves is unmistakably on. It answers **no
toast**: it watches the switch through `Settings.onChange` and, like the panel and the whisper stack,
**follows** the game window on a 30 ms virtual-thread loop.

**The banner cannot be dismissed, only obeyed.** Its one button is *Turn off*, and it switches the feature
off (`BannerActions.turnOff` → `settings.update`, the same `auto_pass_turn` the overlay's pill and the
hotkey flip); the banner then goes because the switch went, not the other way round. There is deliberately
**no cross that hides the sign and leaves the turns ending**: a player who has stepped away comes back to
a game that has been playing itself, and the only thing telling them so is this pill — a version they
could have waved away an hour earlier would be worse than no banner at all. (It *did* work that way once,
with a `dismissed` flag and a cross; the flag is gone, and so is the state where the feature ran unsigned.)

Its UI is cut on the same interface/impl seam as the others (`ui/BannerView`, `ui/BannerContent`,
`ui/BannerActions`, `ui/banner/SwingBanner`), so all the deciding is tested with no screen
(`AutoPassBannerTest`). `BannerContent` carries **two** strings — the heading names the feature in caps for
the glance, the message spells out the consequence for the player who stops — because neither sentence
does both jobs well.

## Auto-accept trades — no hotkey, the overlay's switch

Accepts a trade one of the player's own characters asks of another. When A opens an exchange with B,
it is **B** that the game raises a toast for — `Alpha te propose de faire un échange` — and that toast
**names the asker** (in the message, no quotes). That name is the whole discriminator: the trade is
*internal* when the message carries the name of one of the player's own windows (the receiver's own name
excepted, since it is one of ours too), and it accepts it for them; a stranger's is left exactly as it
was.

The accept presses the game's accept key (`ENTER`, a constant). Sending a keystroke needs the window to
hold the keyboard, so — for now — the accept is a **blink**: `takeOver()`, focus B, press, then focus
straight back to where the player was (read before the blink). `accept()` is the one method to change if
a truly background posted keystroke is ever shown to work against the game.

**This is where it "thinks differently" from the auto-focus.** The notification auto-focus answers
*every* game toast, so on its own it would jump to B and undo the point of accepting in place. So
`NotificationListener` takes the `claims` predicate above and stands aside when it fires;
`ExchangeAccepter.claims()` is a **pure function** of the toast, the switch and the windows, so both
features decide the same without a handshake and without a race. A **stranger's** trade is not claimed:
the auto-focus takes the player to the receiving window and does nothing else, which is exactly what a
real trade offer deserves. The asker's name is matched as a **whole word** (`SuperAlpha` is not our
`Alpha`). **On by default** — passing items between one's own accounts is the daily bread of
multi-boxing, and it only ever fires on a trade a player's own character asked for — and session-only
like the other switch (not persisted to `overlay.json`).

## Whisper toast — no hotkey

Turns a private message into a quiet card instead of a jump. A whisper — a game toast whose message reads
`de <sender> : <line>` — would otherwise pull the whole screen to the whispered character through the
notification auto-focus, which is too much for one line of chat. So `WhisperToaster` stands in
front of that toast: it recognises the whisper by the **shape of its message** (a constant pattern kept
by the feature, the French wording being the game's), and rather than move the player it shows a small
card at the **left edge of the game**, centred top to bottom — who was whispered (`GameWindow.nameIn`
the title), by whom, and what they said. The card lives five seconds (`TOAST_LIFETIME`), a **close cross**
takes it down early, and a **click** on it focuses the receiver so the player can answer (on a virtual
thread — `FocusManager` sleeps). Several whispers **stack**, newest at the bottom.

It is the mirror of `ExchangeAccepter` and `TurnPasser`: a feature that registers with
`NotificationManager`, speaks of characters, and exposes a **pure `claims(Notification)`** the auto-focus
consults. Its one novelty is a **UI surface**, cut on the overlay's interface/impl seam so all the
deciding stays testable with no screen: `ui/ToastContent` (the immutable snapshot), `ui/ToastActions`
(`open`/`dismiss`), `ui/ToastView` (the narrow port), and `ui/SwingToastStack` (the only whisper class
that knows Swing — the **same anti-focus discipline** as the overlay: `JWindow`, always-on-top,
`setFocusableWindowState(false)`, nothing typed, clicks routed by hand; **do not add `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`**).
Unlike the panel the window is sized to the **stack alone**, so it blocks only a narrow band, not the
whole game. Like the panel it **follows**: one virtual thread re-reads the foreground game window every
30 ms and keeps the stack pinned to it, or takes it away out of the game — and the same poll is where a
card **dies of old age**, so there is no timer thread per card. The stack is drawn at `overlay_scale`,
the panel's, so it reads at the same size on the same monitor. It is **always active**: a whisper always
toasts instead of focusing, so there is no `Config` field and no switch — it is a direct replacement, and
adds nothing to the player's settings.

**The card fades; the whisper does not.** Every whisper it raises is first written to `core.WhisperLog`,
and the card is raised **under the id the log minted** — so the overlay can list the same message long
after its ten seconds are up, and a click there is the same jump the card offered. The two lifetimes are
why the log is not a field of this class: a card is a thing on screen, a whisper is a thing that happened.
Ten seconds is the right life for a card in the corner of a fight and the wrong one for the line itself,
which the game gives back only by switching to that character and reading the chat.

## Notification auto-focus — no hotkey

The game raises a toast when a background character is attacked, messaged or invited; that toast pulls
the focus to them. It is a *smart* focus: if the player is typing at that moment, their keystrokes are
not stolen.

It **stands aside**, though, for a toast another feature answers in place — see *Auto-accept trades* and
*Whisper toast*: a `Predicate<Notification>` it is built with tells it which toasts to leave alone, so it
never jumps to a character whose exchange is being accepted silently, nor to one whose whisper is already
a card at the edge. The predicate is the **OR** of the trade-accepter's and the whisper toaster's
`claims`, combined in `MinobotApp`; every other toast, an attack or an invitation, it still takes.
