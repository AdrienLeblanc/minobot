/**
 * Plays the same click on every character at once — the counterpart of {@code multi_window_clicker.py}.
 *
 * <p>The player aims at a spot with their own character, presses the hotkey, and every other character
 * clicks the same spot of the game: they all walk to the same place, all talk to the same NPC. The
 * player never leaves the character they are playing — that is the whole point, and everything below
 * serves it.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the click is <em>posted</em> rather than simulated: it is dropped straight into each
 * window's queue, so the other characters act without their windows ever taking the screen. And why the
 * spot travels as a <em>client</em> position, not a screen one: the same client coordinates land on the
 * same in-game spot in every window, wherever they sit on the desktop.
 *
 * <p><strong>A clicked character goes deaf, and there is no cure but the reset hotkey.</strong> The
 * game only raises its Windows toast for a character nobody is watching, and a posted click is — seen
 * from inside the game — a click like any other: it concludes the player is there and stops notifying.
 * The notification auto-focus, which lives on those toasts, dies with them. This was chased down to the
 * end: a single posted click deafens the window it hits and no other; the toast is never raised at all
 * (the Windows notification database stays empty, so there is nothing to miss); and the game cannot be
 * talked out of it. {@code WM_ACTIVATE}, {@code WM_NCACTIVATE}, {@code WM_KILLFOCUS},
 * {@code WM_ACTIVATEAPP}, a full activation/deactivation cycle, even a real {@code SetFocus} through
 * {@code AttachThreadInput} — all measured, all ignored. Only an activation that genuinely brings the
 * window up on screen re-arms it, which is precisely what {@link #resetCharacters()} does and why it
 * exists. <strong>Do not add a "fix" here that posts messages at the game: that ground is burnt.</strong>
