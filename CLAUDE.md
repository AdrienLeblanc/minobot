# Minobot

A quality-of-life application for **Dofus Retro**, for players running several accounts at once. It
sits silently in the background, listens for hotkeys and Windows notifications, and acts on the game
windows.

## Build

```shell
./mvnw verify              # compile + tests
./mvnw -Pdist verify       # → target/dist/Minobot/Minobot.exe (portable, runtime included)
java -jar target/minobot.jar
```

The Maven wrapper downloads Maven itself; only a **JDK 25** is required. If `JAVA_HOME` does not
point at it, prefix the command: `JAVA_HOME=C:\path\to\jdk-25 ./mvnw verify`.

    ├── group/          the invitation relay.

```

**A handful of interfaces are the only doors to the outside world:** `win32.WindowApi` (the screen),
`core.Input` (the keyboard and mouse), and the `ui` views we draw — `OverlayView` (the panel),
`ToastView` (the whisper stack), `BannerView` (the auto-pass banner). Everything else is code that runs
in a test, on any OS, with no game running — which is why there are 215 tests.

**Keep it that way.** Do not call `user32.dll`, `java.awt.Robot` or Swing from anywhere but their
implementations: a feature that reaches past `WindowApi` becomes untestable.

### A feature speaks of characters; only the core speaks of windows

A `long` is a handle, `PostMessage` is a message, `SW_HIDE` is a flag — and none of them are what the
player asked for. The player asked for *every character to click the same spot*, for *the next character*,
for *their characters back in order in the taskbar*. A feature that reads like the story the player would
tell is a feature whose bugs are visible: `GroupManager` says a leader invites, the invitee accepts, and
the relay stops — and the reason the relay must stop is right there to be seen.

So a feature loops over **characters** (`GameWindow`, which carries a `name()`), and it keeps whatever
Windows demands — the retry on a refused `PostMessage`, the `lParam`, the `SW_RESTORE` — in one named
leaf at the bottom of the file. **The technical detail is not hidden, it is placed**: it stops being the
first thing read, and the constraint that justifies it is the comment above it.

### Where the rest of this document lives

This file stays small on purpose — it is loaded into context **every session**. The detail is placed
next to the code it governs, in a `CLAUDE.md` per package that loads only when you work in that subtree:

- **`src/main/java/fr/minobot/app/CLAUDE.md`** — `Config` (what a player may change), the `Feature` enum,
  and the two-tier config on disk (`Settings`, `OverlayState`, `config.json` vs `overlay.json`).
- **`src/main/java/fr/minobot/core/CLAUDE.md`** — concurrency (the polling thread, the swapped hotkey
  table, virtual-thread callbacks) and **the foreground as a single resource** (`FocusManager`). Read it
  before adding any feature: they all compete for the foreground.
- **`src/main/java/fr/minobot/feature/CLAUDE.md`** — a slim index; each feature's behaviour lives in
  its subpackage's own `CLAUDE.md` (`window/`, `group/`, `overlay/`, `notification/`), loaded only when
  you work there.
- **`src/main/java/fr/minobot/ui/CLAUDE.md`** — the interface/impl seam for the screen and the
  anti-focus discipline the two Swing classes (`SwingOverlay`, `SwingToastStack`) must obey.

## Conventions

- **Code and comments in English.**
- A comment states a constraint the code cannot show — a Windows quirk, a race, a reason. Never what
  the next line does.
- Windows handles are plain `long` (`Win32.NULL_HANDLE` for none), which is what an `HWND` is on the
  Win64 ABI.
- A native call that *cannot be made* (a wrong FFM signature) throws `Win32Exception`. A call that
  *fails* (a dead handle, a refused focus) returns `false` / `Optional.empty()` — that is normal, and
  the callers tolerate it.
- Never pack a mouse `lParam` by hand: call `Win32.makeLParam`. It is the likeliest silent bug of the
  whole codebase, and it is locked down by `Win32Test`.
- Tests drive `FakeWindowApi` (an in-memory desktop) and `FakeInput`. If a change is hard to test,
  that is a signal about the change, not about the tests.
